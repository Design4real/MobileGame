	* (Lib) Textfield cursor height calculation determined by an average of the character minY and maxY instead of the line height

	* (Lib) Textfield.maxChars property added to API, flash IDE text property "Max chars" support added also.

	* (Lib) Added MovieClip.currentLabel.

	* (Lib) Added MovieClip.playBackwards().

	* (Lib) TextField backwards computability update.

	* (All) Font rendering quality issue resolved, changed texture filtering to point ( will add global filtering options in the next update ).

	* (Lib) TextFormat.leading added, allows changing the line spacing.

	* (Lib) TextField.getGlyph( char id ), get underlying glyph which allows character customisation eg. change character render width.

	* (Lib) TextField input issue on web player when handling return key, added /r keycode to line-return detection.

	* (All) Font export classname changed filter descriptors to hash for speed, requires will break shared fonts so re-export of all shared asset required.

	* (Lib) TextFormat.exportedStyleName added.

	* (All)  Window->uniSWF->Export Options -> fonts -> "Embed unicode ranges", allows adding any unicode range to the font export eg. CJK Unified Ideographs would be "4E00-9FFF", please note this will take a while as its generating 20991 glyphs so its probably best narrow down the charset and export fonts in a separate asset.

	* (Converter) Font layout engine now uses grids to optimise compile time for large character sets, 20k characters takes < 30 seconds.

	* (Converter) Font rendering in win32 improved, fixed floating point number rounding error.
